# OutFind
OutFind is a concept mobile application designed to reduce the mental stress and time burden students face when choosing what to wear. The idea originated from recognizing a common but overlooked problem. <br>
From Aug 2024 through May 2025, I was a part of the Internet Engineering Innovation Scholars cohort. This repository focuses on **process, reasoning, and early-stage product thinking**, rather than a finalized application.

## Research & Validation
- Surveyed ~100 college students using Google Forms
- Analyzed trends around time spent choosing clothes  
- Used survey data to shape core features and prioritize usability
- Created a problem-solution framework based on real user input

(Poster artifacts included survey results, feature breakdowns, and future directions.)

## Problem Statement
Through a survey of 100 students, we found that:
- Despite 45.8% spend under 5 minutes selecting an outfit, over 54% spend more than 5 minutes, with 12.5% exceeding 15 minutes. 
- 63.3% of respondents reported that this time could be used more productively, reinforcing the opportunity for a time-saving solution.

This led us to ask:  
**What if outfit decisions could be simplified, personalized, and stress-free?**

## Solution Concept
OutFind proposes a mobile app that allows users to:
- Digitally organize their closet
- Generate outfit combinations from existing clothing
- Share and browse outfit inspiration
- Save time while boosting confidence in daily outfit choices

The goal is not fashion perfection, but **decision relief**.

## My Role & Contributions
- Created the initial ideation for the app
- Conducted the survey design and interpretation
- Helped define feature requirements and user flow
- Translated XCode & Swift logic to compile backend with Python and Flask
- Prepared for group presentation at the URC

## Lessons Learned
- Communicating and working in a team to achieve a common goal
- How to validate a product idea using real user data
- Translating qualitative stress points into concrete features
- The importance of scoping and feasibility in student-led projects
- How early technical decisions affect long-term scalability

## What I Would Change
Looking back with more experience, I would focus on improving overall workflow and productivity. I know exactly what skills were needed and how to effectively execute them if I did it today. While the project was completed, it was a learning experience. Becuase I did not have the confidence in myself, the experience to clearly define and structure tasks for a large-scale project held me back. 

## Project Status
This project is complete. While I do not have access to the complete final application used in our live demo, this was an amazing learning opportunity.
